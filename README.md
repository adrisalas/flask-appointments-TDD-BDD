## Info

A simple webpage in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) I did to learn how to develop using **BDD** and **TDD** in this framework.

For BDD I used [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and for TDD I used [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
There is no database, the data is simulated by the "DataFacade.py" file.
